# General context 

The ultimate aim of this workshop is to make you able to start a data analysis projects that are: 

- self-contained (within a single folder)
- have a record of changes made to the files with git
- make it easier to collaborate with other people
- make it simpler to connect the analysis with a scientific output like a paper
- to structure analysis in a more reproducible way (or at least more easily inspectable).

This is will: 

- improve transparency of your reseach projects
- make it easier to share both with your research team but also public, funding agency and other researcher
- facilitate the assessment of the quality of your work including peer review.
