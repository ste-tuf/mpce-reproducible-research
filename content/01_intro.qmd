# General context 

The ultimate aim of this workshop is to give you the key to make data analysis projects tha: 

- are self-contained (within a single folder)
- have a record of changes made to the files with git
- make it easier to collaborate with other people
- connect analysis and scientific output like a paper
- are more reproducible (or at least easier to review).

This is will: 

- improve transparency of your reseach projects
- make it easier to share both with your research team but also public, funding agency and other researcher
- facilitate the assessment of the quality of your work including peer review.
