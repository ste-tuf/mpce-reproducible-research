### Graphic User Interface (GUI)

Git can be use directly as a command line program directly from a terminal. This
is usefull to automate stuff but not that user friendly. Therefore many software 
profice a nice graphic interfacte to manage and vizualise your git repository. 

On Windows git-gui, the default GUI, can be installed at the same time as git.
RStudio, VSCode also have a pane dedicated to Git which doesn't need any installation.

For this workshop, we will use Git-nuro, a free and open-source GUT which is available on any OS. 
Go to this page [https://gitnuro.com/](https://gitnuro.com/), download and install it.
