3.  Table creation with `gt`
4.  Bonus: Git branch and remote repo

## Functional Programming in R with `purrr`

Functions can be easily applied to multiple elements using
**functional** functions: special functions that uses another function
as one of its arguments.

-   Part of the tidyverse
-   Focus on functional programming
-   Simplify complex data manipulations

::: notes
The `purrr` package is a part of the tidyverse suite of packages, which
is designed to make data science easier and more consistent in R.
`purrr` focuses on functional programming and helps simplify complex
data manipulations, especially with lists and data frames.
:::

## Functional Programming in R with `purrr`

-   The `map` family of functions: works by taking a vector (or list),
    applying a function to each of those items, and outputting the
    results from each function call.

## Functional Programming in R with `purrr`

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
paste_text <- function(x) { 
  paste(x, "seconds have passed")
}
purrr::map(1:3, paste_text)
```

::: notes
https://r-cubed-intermediate.rostools.org/sessions/functions

The name map() doesn’t mean a geographic map, it is the mathematical
meaning of map: To use a function on each item in a set of items.

::: notes
-   `map()`: Applies a function to each element of a list and returns a
    list
-   `map_lgl()`: Returns a logical vector
-   `map_int()`: Returns an integer vector
-   `map_dbl()`: Returns a double vector
-   `map_chr()`: Returns a character vector
-   `map_df()`: Applies a function to each element and returns a data
    frame

## Functional Programming in R with `purrr`

Benefits of Using `purrr`

-   Reduces redundancy
    -   Write less code by avoiding repetitive loops
-   Increases code readability
    -   Clear and concise syntax
-   Easier to update and debug

## Dynamic Report with Quarto {.smaller}

What is Quarto?

-   Open-source scientific publishing system

-   Supports R and Python

-   Integrates code, text, and outputs in one document (HTML, DOCX)

![Quarto by Allison Horst](/img/quarto.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
-   Produces HTML, PDF, Word documents, presentations, etc.

Benefits:

-   Reproducible research
-   Automated reporting

## Quarto Document Structure

```` markdown
---
title: "Descriptive Statistics Report"
author: "Your Name"
format: html # or docx 
---

Blabla

# Results
  
```{{r}}
library(purrr)
numeric_vars <- c("creatinine", "lead", "barium", "cadmium")
descriptive_stats <- map(numeric_vars, ~ compute_numeric(nh2007[[.x]]))
descriptive_stats
```
  
````

::: notes
-   YAML header defines document metadata.
-   R code chunk for analysis.
-   Results section for displaying outputs.
:::

## Markdown {.smaller}

Text formatting:

-   `**bold**`, `_italic_`,
-   `# Headers 1`, `## Headers 2`

Lists:

-   Unordered lists with `-` or `*`

-   Ordered lists with `1.`

R Code chunks:

```` markdown
```{{r}}
summary(cars)
```
````

## Table creation with `gt`

Create publication ready tables in R directly from your data.

There is many functions to style and format tables to match your needs:

-   Automatic number formating
-   Nice labels with special characters
-   Table header spanner
-   Cells highlight

Tables can be exported in many format including html or MS Word.

## Table creation with `gt`

## Bonus: Git branching

Basic Git Workflow:

-   Create a branch (test new things): `git branch new-branch-name`
-   Switch to new branch: `git checkout new-branch-name`
-   Commit changes: `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`
-   Merge branch: `git checkout main`, `git merge new-branch-name`

::: notes
-   Isolates development work
-   Allows multiple features/bug fixes to be developed concurrently
-   Simplifies collaboration and code review
:::

## Bonus: Git local and remote
