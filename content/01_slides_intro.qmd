## ❔ {.center}

**How many of you have read a method in a paper and wondered how they
actually did it?**

**Have you ever received confusing code? Or maybe written your own
confusing code?**

**... or about open access, open data, open methods/protocols, or open
source?**

## Reproducibility

Reproducibility

:   Obtain consistent results using the **same data and code** as the
    original study.

Replicability

:   Obtain consistent results **across studies** aimed at answering the
    same scientific question using **new data** or other new
    computational methods.

::: notes
Unreplicability can be useful to science and help build knowledge.

-   Domain of study
-   Complex / unknown systems
-   Researchers choices:
    -   **Study design**
    -   **Mistakes**
    -   **Misconduct**
    -   **Poor reporting and publication bias**

Source of not useful non-replication:

-   publication bias
-   misaligned incentives
-   inappropriate statistical inference
-   poor study design
-   errors
-   incomplete reporting of a study
:::

## Reproducibility

Related to data collection, computation, and analysis:

-   Data acquisition
-   Data management
-   Analysis
-   Reporting results

::: callout-important
Almost all the steps of an epidemiology study can be involved!

## Workshop organization

A little bit of theory and lots of hands-on exercises. Each part of the
workshop has a dedicated page where you can find slides and instructions
to follow in your breakout rooms.

-   **Introduction (20 minutes): a little bit of theory**

-   **Hands-on Activity 1: a simple reproducible project (40 minutes)**

-   **Break (15 minutes)**

-   **Hands-on Activity 2: create a nice report (50 minutes)**

-   **Closing Remarks and Q&A (15 minutes)**

## Getting help

-   Maybe your teammates can help

-   Put a comment in the chat if you are struggling

-   No stupid questions—we're all learning here, *including me*

    -   Be open-minded

    -   Be supportive

    -   Be inclusive

## Let's form teams of 3

1.  Have you ever created and used custom functions in R?
2.  Do you ever have use `map` functions from `purrr` package?
3.  Have you ever created a report using RMarkdown, Quarto or Jupyter
    notebook?

If you answered "No" to all three questions: **Beginner**

If you answered "Yes" to one or two questions: **Intermediate**

If you answered "Yes" to all three questions: **Advanced**

::: notes
Let's mix things up and get to know each other! We'll form teams of 3
with varying levels of R experience.
