This workshop aims to provide young epidemiology researchers knowledge
and skills to increase reproducibility of their research.

The first part of the workshop will begin by defining reproducibility
and its importance in epidemiology, exploring associated challenges and
opportunities. In the second part of the workshop, focus will be put on
practical solutions and their application so that young researchers can
implement in their analysis and writing.

The workshop will be held on Zoom. The link should have been send to you.


# Goals

-   Explain what is a reproducibile analysis workflow

-   Show how to improve the organisation of your R projects

-   Show and apply simple tools to make your analysis code cleaner,
    shorter, documented and more reproducible

-   Introduce to Git to track changes in your code
